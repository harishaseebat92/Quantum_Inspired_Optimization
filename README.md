# Efficient Approaches to the Bin Packing Problem  
ðŸš€ **Optimizing Bin Packing with ILP, QUBO, and Quantum Methods**  

## Overview  
This repository presents various techniques for solving the **Bin Packing Problem (BPP)**, a classical combinatorial optimization challenge. It incorporates traditional methods such as **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** and **Brute Force Algorithms**, alongside quantum-inspired approaches including **QUBO**, **Quantum Annealing**, and **Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA)**.  

The goal is to explore the efficiency of these approaches in minimizing the number of bins required while respecting weight constraints.  

## Features  
- **ILP Formulation:** A mathematical approach to solve BPP with constraints and objective functions.  
- **Brute Force Algorithm:** Exhaustive search-based solution.  
- **QUBO Conversion:** Reformulation of ILP into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem.  
- **Quantum Annealing:** Utilizes D-Wave's Ocean Framework for solving QUBO models.  
- **Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA):** Quantum circuit-based optimization for finding solutions.
